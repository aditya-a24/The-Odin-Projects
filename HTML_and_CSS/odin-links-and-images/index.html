    <!-- href(hypertext reference) is an attribute, An HTML attribute gives additional information to an HTML element and always goes in the element’s opening tag. -->
    <!-- The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened. The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it. 
    The prevention of access that is caused by noopener prevents phishing attacks where the opened link may change the original webpage to a different one to trick users. This is referred to as tabnabbing. Adding the noreferrer value can be done if you wish to not let the opened link know that your webpage links to it. -->
